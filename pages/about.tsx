          Hi, I'm Oyekunle Fiyinfoluwa, a web developer with my focus currently in the frontend.
           I enjoy creating software that works and debugging (The dopamine rush after squashing the bug is amazing). I can't put a date to when I first picked interest in computers
           but I took my first step, after previous first steps, to becoming a developer in 2020 when I read O'Reilly's Head First HTML and CSS during the covid-19 lockdown,
            fastforward to today and I still am mind blown by the possibilities that can be created through computers.
        </p>
        <p className={`content ${style.paragraph}`}>
          I started off on Fiverr where I built a few websites for people using wix.
           Then I have built apps using various technologies which I had to learn in the moment to achieve the expected results while freelancing. 
           Technologies like: shopify liquid, solidity, php & laravel etc.
           Now I'm focusing all my energy into building performant and aesthetically pleasing UI.
           I primarily use React.js/Next.js and javascript/typescript.
        </p>
        <p className={`content ${style.paragraph}`}>
          When I'm not working, I play video games, watch football matches (Manchester united ðŸ˜ª), read books especially on the human condition (Viktor Frankl, Mark Manson and Robert Greene).
          I also enjoy watching movies especially superhero fiction genres and in my opinion I believe having the ability to get the computer to do exactly what's in mind is a super power. 
        </p>
